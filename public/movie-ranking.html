<h1>The best anime movies according to Nina.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Your Name - Kimi no Na wa [君の名は。]</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime movie. Romance and fantasy in perfect harmony. </p>
<h3>Hotarubi no Mori e [蛍火の杜へ]</h3>
<p>My secret tip. It's a short anime movie but it melts the heart in many ways.</p>
<h3>Wolf Children [おおかみこどもの雨と雪]</h3>
<p>The topic of this movie is very emotional - the struggles of a single parent.</p>
