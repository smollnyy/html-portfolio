<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Nina and I'm working towards becoming a creative web developer. I am currently taking the online course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu on Udemy, and I'm finding it very easy to understand and well explained. There is a lot to practice and it's my goal to put my all into every task.</p>

<p>My website has the latest updates on my projects, so you can follow along with my progress.</p>

<p>It would be greatly appreciated if you could support and guide me along my journey to becoming a fully-fledged web developer.</p>
